    "The term big data is asoociated to datasets that cannot be processed, stored and transformed using traditional applications and tools because of high volume, high velocity and high variety. By high volume, we mean datasets that not only require high storage capacity, usually beyond 1T, but also datasets that are too big to have a decent processing and thoughput time. By high velocity, we mean data that requires real-time processing with throughput speeds that can be bursty. High variety includes data that comes from different formats, some structured some that are not, that all need to be ingested and transformed to be processed. Big data is simply changing the way we used to collect and analyze data at the time that it opens opportunity to increase the scale, scope and intimacy of the analyses that we are now able to do.\n",

    "The social web is a leading source of big data applications given our ability to log almost anything that the user does when interacting to an application. In my field, I've seen how online videos are increasingly the way users consume media. A video, per se, is an unstructured data item and its interactions are usually captured by leading social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Youtube in the form of JSON, a semi unstructured format that can capture user interactions such as likes, shares and comments. Across the internet, the amount of videos being upload and downstream is exploding making it a challenge to measure real-time, the media consuming habits of our target users. Big data can help in providing insights from all of this information so that we can better predict the taste of users visiting our site properties to serve them content they like.  \n"
