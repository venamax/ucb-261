Multiplying lots of probabilities, which are between 0 and 1, can result in floating-point underflow. Since log(xy) = log(x) + log(y), it is better to perform all computations by summing logs of probabilities rather than multiplying probabilities. Please pay attention to probabilites that are zero!
